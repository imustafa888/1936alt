EVT_3182056_DESC;Although passed in 1935, it was not until Roosevelt's election victory in 1936 that the legislation of his 'Second New Deal' was considered permanent. Including the Works Progress Administration, National Labor Relations Act, and the Social Security Act, this program was designed to boost production and put the great masses of unemployed to work. A mixed success, it did help restore the confidence of the American public as it eased its way out of the Great Depression.;;;;Auch wenn der 'Second new deal' schon 1935 verabschiedet wurde, wurde er erst nach der Wiederwahl Roosevelts 1936 als verbindlich betrachtet.

Dies gelang zwar nur beschrдnkt, aber es half ungemein, der US Bevцlkerung das Vertrauen in sich selbst zurьckzugeben und erleichterte so den Weg aus der grossen Depression der frьhen 30'er Jahre.;;;;;;x

EVT_172068_DESC;The director Leni Riefenstahl was famous for her documentary on the 1934 Fascist Party convention in Nuremberg, called Triumph of the Will. It was chosen as best film in the 1930s at both the Venice Film Festival and the Paris World Fair. In 1938, Leni Riefenstahl finished her latest project, a two part film named 'Olympia' on the Olympic Games in Berlin 1936. They were 'Olympia I - The Festival of the People' and 'Olympia II - The Festival of Beauty'. Many cameras and much equipment were needed to make the films. During the making, filming techniques and camera equipment developed rapidly. The films served as propaganda, as they focused on the German athletes as rolemodels for the fascist physical ideal.;;;;Die deutsche Regisseurin Leni Riefenstahl wurde berьhmt wegen ihrer Dokumentation ьber den Nьrnberger Parteitag der NSDAP 1934, der unter dem Motto 'Triumph des Willens' stand.

Im ehemaligen deutschen Teil ( Polen A ) war ein Grossteil der Industrie konzentriert, wдhrend im цstlichen Landesteil ( Polen B ) die Landwirtschaft vorherrschte. Im Februar 1937 begann die Regierung mit dem Aufbau einer zentralen Industriezone zwischen den Flьssen Vistula und San. Die Absicht war, den industriell unterentwickelten Osten zu stдrken, die Produktion von Kriegsgьtern zu steigern und die Arbeitslosigkeit zu senken. Im Laufe der nдchsten Jahre entstand ein grosses Stahlwerk bei Stalowa Wola, eine Munitionsfabrik bei Sanok, eine Fabrik zur Herstellung von Hand - und Faustfeuerwaffen bei Radom, Flugzeugwerke bei Mielec und Rzeszow sowie einige andere Industriebetriebe zur Herstellung allgemeiner Kriegsgьter.;After Poland regained independence in 1918 the boundaries between the former occupants were still clearly visible.
